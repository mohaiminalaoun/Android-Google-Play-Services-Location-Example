# Android Google Play Services Location Example

A very simple example that demonstrates how to use Google Play Services to obtain user's location, and get periodic updates about user's location. 
The location is obtained as longitude and latitude values. 

This example uses Google Play services (GoogleApiClient) and the FusedLocationApi.
